Codecademy React Notes:

const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>; this is not JS or HTML, its JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML.
What does "syntax extension" mean?
In this case, it means that JSX is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers can't read it!
If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled. 
That means that before the file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.

<h1>Hello world</h1> = JSX element

- JSX syntax allows for onlw one outtermost element, all other elements must be nested within it


1. REACT METHODS:

ReactDOM.render() - ReactDOM is the name of a JS library. This library contains several React-specific methods, all of which deal with the DOM in some way or another.
.render is the actual methods. It takes a JSX expression, creates a corresponding tree of DOM nodes, and adds that tree to the DOM. That is the way to make a JSX expression appear onscreen.
ReactDOM.render()'s first argument should evaluate to a JSX expression, it doesn't have to literally be a JSX expression.
The first argument could also be a variable, so long as that variable evaluates to a JSX expression.
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

The following code example created a <ul> JSX element, and renders it to the app:
var myList = (
  <ul>
    <li>Brady</li>
    <li>Churro</li>
    <li>Izzy</li>
    <li>Lundy</li>
  </ul>
)

ReactDOM.render(myList, document.getElementById('app'));


2. IMPORTANT: One special thing about ReactDOM.render() is that it only updates DOM elements that have changed.
            This is significant! Only updating the necessary DOM elements is a large part of what makes React so successful.


3. VIRTUAL DOM: Its like a blueprint of the actual DOM
    Here's what happens when you try to update the DOM in React:
        -The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
        -The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects have changed.
        -The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
        -Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.

WRAPPING TEXT INSIDE JSX ELEMENTS WILL CAUSE THEM TO BE READ AS JAVASCRIPT!!!
