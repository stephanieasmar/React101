// There's a more compact way to write conditionals in JSX: the ternary operator.
// The ternary operator works the same way in React as it does in regular JavaScript. However, it shows up in React surprisingly often.
// Recall how it works: you write x ? y : z, where x, y, and z are all JavaScript expressions. When your code is executed, x is evaluated as either "truthy" or "falsy." If x is truthy, then the entire ternary operator returns y. If x is falsy, then the entire ternary operator returns z.
